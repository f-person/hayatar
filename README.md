# Hayatar

This project is an attempt in building an Armenian keyboard for iOS and iPadOS that
feels native and is usable :).

## Roadmap

The short-term and mid-term roadmap is in [issues](https://github.com/f-person/hayatar/issues).
Longer-term stuff is below:

1. Add instructions for installing the keyboard to the main app
1. Once I'm satisfied with all the above stuff, refactor the codebase
1. Add alternative Armenian layouts (e.g. typewriter)
