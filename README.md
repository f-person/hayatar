This project is an attempt in building an Armenian keyboard for iOS and iPadOS that
feels native and is usable :).

## Roadmap

1. Implement autocompletion
1. Add haptic feedback
1. Add instructions for installing the keyboard to the main app
1. Once I'm satisfied with all the above stuff, refactor the codebase
1. Add alternative Armenian layouts (e.g. typewriter)
1. Add customization options
	* Custom callout characters for the colon and semicolon
	* Disable haptic feedback
	* Disable sound
